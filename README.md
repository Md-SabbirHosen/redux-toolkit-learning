# Redux Toolkit Learning

This repository contains my practice code from learning Redux Toolkit, based on the tutorials I completed. It includes examples, concepts, and hands-on implementations to understand how Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications.

## Features

- **Redux Store Configuration**: Efficiently setting up a Redux store with minimal boilerplate.
- **Slices and Reducers**: Understanding `createSlice` to create reducers and actions.
- **Dispatch Function**: Triggering actions using the `dispatch` function to update the state.
- **Async Thunks**: Managing asynchronous logic and API calls with `createAsyncThunk`.
- **Selector Functions**: Extracting and computing state with reusable selectors.
- **DevTools and Enhancements**: Leveraging Redux DevTools for debugging and state tracking.
